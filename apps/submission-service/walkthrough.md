5. Authors withdraw if needed
6. **Chair views all submissions with pagination/filtering** ← NEW!
7. Chair manually accepts/rejects papers
8. Authors upload camera-ready for accepted papers
9. Chair exports proceedings

❌ **Missing (Review Workflow):**
- Reviewer assignment
- Submit reviews with scores
- Internal PC discussion
- Automated decision aggregation
- Authors view anonymized reviews

## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### **Fix 1: JWT Authentication** (6 locations)
**Problem:** `req.user.id` was undefined  
**Solution:** Changed to `req.user.userId` across all endpoints

**Files Modified:**
- [controller.ts:53](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.controller.ts#L53) - Upload
- [controller.ts:84](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.controller.ts#L84) - Get by ID
- [controller.ts:106](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.controller.ts#L106) - Update
- [controller.ts:123](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.controller.ts#L123) - Update status
- [controller.ts:131](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.controller.ts#L131) - Withdraw

### **Fix 2: Environment Variables**
**Problem:** `.env` not loaded  
**Solution:** Added `envFilePath` to ConfigModule  
**File:** [submission-service.module.ts:16-18](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.module.ts#L16-L18)

### **Fix 3: Database Port**
**Problem:** Hardcoded 5432, actual 5435  
**Solution:** Read from `process.env.DB_PORT`  
**File:** [submission-service.module.ts:26](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.module.ts#L26)

### **Fix 4: Supabase Bucket**
**Problem:** Used `SUPABASE_BUCKET` with fallback `papers`, actual was `SUPABASE_BUCKET_NAME` → `submission`  
**Solution:** Updated env var name and fallback  
**File:** [submission-service.service.ts:104,116](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.service.ts#L104)

### **Fix 5: Conference Service Integration**
**Problem:** Upload failed when Conference Service down  
**Solution:** Made deadline check optional (warning only)  
**File:** [conference.client.ts:28-33](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/modules/integration/conference.client.ts#L28-L33)

### **Fix 6: Update Endpoint Content-Type**
**Problem:** `updateDto` undefined when using form-data  
**Solution:** Documented to use `application/json` for PATCH  
**Impact:** User education, not code change

### **Fix 7: Camera-Ready TypeORM Cascade**
**Problem:** `submission_id` became null after INSERT due to cascade  
**Solution:** Used `update()` instead of `save()` for timestamp  
**File:** [submission-service.service.ts:461-463](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.service.ts#L461-L463)

### **Fix 8: Authors Parsing Bug** ⭐ NEW!
**Problem:** Authors always empty (`authors: []`) in response  
**Root Cause:** 
- Form-data sends authors as JSON string
- Code assigned string directly without parsing
- Field names mismatch: `name` → `author_name`, `isCorresponding` → `is_corresponding`

**Solution:**
1. Parse JSON string from form-data
2. Map camelCase fields to snake_case for database
3. Validate JSON format

**Code:**
```typescript
// Parse JSON string
const authorsData = typeof dto.authors === 'string' 
  ? JSON.parse(dto.authors) 
  : dto.authors;

// Map fields
parsedAuthors = authorsData.map((author: any) => ({
  author_name: author.name,
  email: author.email,
  is_corresponding: author.isCorresponding || false
}));
```

**File:** [submission-service.service.ts:156-171](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.service.ts#L156-L171)

### **Fix 9: Swagger UI File Upload** ⭐ NEW!
**Problem:** Camera-ready endpoint missing file input in Swagger UI  
**Solution:** Added `@ApiConsumes` and `@ApiBody` decorators  
**File:** [submission-service.controller.ts:184-197](file:///d:/1.XDPMOOP/uth-confms/apps/submission-service/src/submission-service.controller.ts#L184-L197)

## 🐛 Debugging Journey

### **Issue 1: Update Endpoint Hung**
**Symptoms:** 500 error, no logs after deadline check  
**Investigation:**
1. Added debug logging at each step
2. Discovered code stopped after `console.log('✅ Deadline check passed')`
3. Found `updateDto` was undefined
4. Root cause: Form-data instead of JSON

**Resolution:** User switched to JSON Content-Type

### **Issue 2: Camera-Ready Upload Failed**
**Symptoms:** `submission_id` null constraint violation  
**Investigation:**
1. File INSERT succeeded (version 104, 105...)
2. UPDATE query immediately after set `submission_id = null`
3. TypeORM cascade was syncing relations incorrectly

**Resolution:** Changed from `save(submission)` to `update(id, {timestamp})`

## 📊 Database Schema

### **submission** table:
```sql
id, conference_id, title, abstract, status,
created_by, created_at, updated_at, withdrawn_at,
camera_ready_submitted_at  -- NEW!
```

### **submission_file** table:
```sql
id, submission_id, file_path, version, uploaded_at
```
**Version numbering:**
- 1-99: Regular submissions
- >= 100: Camera-ready files

### **submission_author** table:
```sql
id, submission_id, author_name, email, is_corresponding
```

### **audit_trail** table:
```sql
id, action, entity_type, entity_id, actor_id, details, timestamp
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### **Minor:**
1. **Camera-ready `submittedAt` null in response** - Saved to DB but not returned
   - Workaround: Query DB directly
2. **Hot-reload sometimes fails** - Need manual restart
   - Workaround: Delete `dist` folder and restart

### **No Critical Issues** ✅
